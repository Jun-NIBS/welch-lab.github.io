When not working on research, I enjoy training for triathlons. My favorite thing about triathlons is that swimming, running, and biking provide a nice variety of workouts and a great way to enjoy the outdoors. I also love [playing classical music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0CWYISXO8k) on the piano and regularly assist with music at my [church](http://www.cccpca.org/). I am married to the lovely Jeanna Welch.

We took the picture on this page during a recent trip to Hawaii.
