I recently completed my Ph.D. under the direction of [Jan Prins](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~prins/) in the Department of Computer Science at UNC. I was also a trainee of the [UNC Big Data 2 Knowledge program (BD2K)](http://sph.unc.edu/sph-news/bd2k-program-to-train-researchers-in-biomedical-big-data/) and the Curriculum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB). My research interests lie in the field of computational biology. For my dissertation, I developed algorithms to decipher dynamics of gene expression using RNA sequencing data. Most recently, I have focused on methods for analysis of single cell RNA-seq data. I joined the lab of [Evan Macosko](http://macoskolab.com/) at the Broad Institute as a postdoctoral fellow in August 2017. I have also accepted a position as Assistant Professor at the University of Michiganâ€™s Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics starting in August 2018.
